# business-card-webpage
Repo for a business card-type webpage template

The README file serves as documentation for the project. I'll put very basic or general information in here, as I can add more specific and detailed comments directly into the files later on.

Resources for learning more about the languages and frameworks we'll be using for this project:

Bootstrap 4: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/

JQuery: https://jquery.com/

CSS3: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/

Other helpful tools: https://codepen.io/projects/# (to see how the three languages work together and also serves as a scratch to see how your code works prior to integrating into the project)
